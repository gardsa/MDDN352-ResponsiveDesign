        Responsive Web Design

        With such a large number of different-sized screens available, responsive web design is becoming more and more critical. There are a number of basic layout principles that we can utilise to embrace the fluidity of the web.
      </h2>
      <div class="section group">
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Responsive > Adapative</h3>
          <p>
            Responsive is fluid and adapts to the size of the screen, whereas adaptive uses static layouts at particular breakpoints.
          </p>
      	</div>
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Flow</h3>
          <p>
            Smaller screen sizes mean content takes up more vertical space, so you need to consider the ordering (or flow) of elements across all screen sizes.
          </p>
      	</div>
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Relative Units</h3>
          <p>
            Using units such as % and em over px means that your content will appear correctly over a variety of screen sizes.
          </p>
      	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section group">
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Breakpoints</h3>
          <p>
            A breakpoint is a predefined point where the CSS rules change, like on this site where larger screens have 3 columns, but a mobile would only see 1 column.
          </p>
      	</div>
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Max/Min Values</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes you want content to take up the full width of a screen, but on a larger screen this would look strange.
          </p>
          <code>
            <span>div {</span>
              <span class="indent">width: 100%;</span>
              <span class="indent">max-width: 1000px;</span>
              <span>}</span>
            </code>
      	</div>
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Nested Objects</h3>
          <p>
            When a lot of elements depend on one another, things get complicated really fast. Wrapping groups of elements in separate containers keeps it clean and tidy.
          </p>
      	</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section group">
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Mobile or Desktop first?</h3>
          <p>
            Designing for mobile first allows you to progressively enhance your design. As mobile has the most limitations, you cater for these first, then add complexity for larger screens.
          </p>
      	</div>
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Fonts</h3>
          <p>
            Webfonts can result in a  slick looking website, however each has to be downloaded, affecting overall page load and speed. System fonts are fast, but when not stored locally, will fall back to a default font.
          </p>
      	</div>
      	<div class="col three-by-three">
          <h3>Bitmap or Vectors?</h3>
          <p>
            Detailed images with fancy effects are better used in a bitmap format such as .jpg, .png, or .gif. Vectors are great for simple icons, with the best choice being either SVG or icon fonts.
